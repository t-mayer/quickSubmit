# quickSubmit for OMP
Quicksubmit plugin for OMP (work in progress...)

Tested with OMP 3.3.0-7

### Description
This plugin is based on the quickSubmit plugin of OJS. It simplifies the sometimes tedious submission process associated with OMP.
Although it is a copy of the quickSubmit plugin of OJS, it differs in several points from the quickSubmit plugin of OJS:
* added OMP-specific information: submission/work type, categories, series to choose from
* since it was important for us to simply upload chapter and book manuscripts and publish them as such, the quickSubmit focuses on connecting and uploading publication formats and chapters quickly
* schedule-for-publication feature is missing in this quickSubmit

PRs are welcome!!
